## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Git Push (Recommended)

1. **Clone your existing GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alikhanfahad/alikhanfahad.github.io.git
   cd alikhanfahad.github.io
   ```

2. **Backup your existing content (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backup
   cp -r *.html *.css *.js assets backup/
   ```

3. **Copy the new files to your repository**
   ```bash
   # Copy from the website_redesign directory to your repository
   cp -r /path/to/website_redesign/* .
   ```

4. **Commit and push the changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Redesign website with computational biology and neuroscience theme"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Verify deployment**
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site
   - Visit https://alikhanfahad.github.io to see your redesigned website

### Option 2: Manual Upload to GitHub

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
   - Visit https://github.com/alikhanfahad/alikhanfahad.github.io

2. **Upload files**
   - Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop all files from the website_redesign directory
   - Commit the changes directly to the main branch

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your site
   - Visit https://alikhanfahad.github.io to see your redesigned website

## Animation Features

The redesigned website includes several stunning animations that reflect computational biology and neuroscience themes:

1. **Neural Network Animation (Hero Section)**
   - Interactive visualization of neural connections
   - Responds to mouse movement
   - Simulates neural signal propagation

2. **Molecular Particles Animation (About Section)**
   - Simulates molecular structures and interactions
   - Interactive particles that respond to mouse movement
   - Represents biological molecules and structures

3. **Brain Connectivity Animation (Education Section)**
   - Visualizes brain region connections
   - Simulates neural signal transmission
   - Scroll-triggered activation

4. **DNA Helix Animation (Projects Section)**
   - 3D representation of DNA structure
   - Rotating helix with base pair connections
   - Scroll-triggered animation

5. **Skill Bar Animations**
   - Neural pathway-inspired progress indicators
   - Pulse animations representing action potentials

## Customization Options

### Changing Colors
The website uses a custom color scheme based on computational biology themes:
- Neural Blue (`#2A3B8F`): Deep blue representing neural networks
- Synapse Green (`#4CAF50`): Vibrant green representing synaptic connections
- Molecular Purple (`#673AB7`): Rich purple representing molecular structures
- Neuron Gold (`#FFC107`): Warm gold for highlighting

To modify these colors, edit the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --neural-blue: #2A3B8F;
  --synapse-green: #4CAF50;
  --molecular-purple: #673AB7;
  --neuron-gold: #FFC107;
  /* other variables */
}
```

### Adjusting Animations
You can customize animation parameters by modifying the initialization in `main.js`. For example:
```javascript
// Neural Network Animation for Hero Section
new NeuralNetworkAnimation('neural-network-animation', {
    nodeCount: 120,  // Increase or decrease for more/fewer nodes
    connectionDistance: 150,  // Adjust connection distance
    colors: {
        nodes: '#4CAF50',
        connections: 'rgba(42, 59, 143, 0.5)',
        pulse: '#FFC107'
    }
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Animation Performance Issues
If animations run slowly on mobile devices:
1. Open `main.js`
2. Find the animation initialization section
3. Reduce the number of particles/nodes for each animation

### Missing Images
If images don't appear:
1. Ensure all image paths in `index.html` are correct
2. Check that images are properly uploaded to the `assets/img/` directory
3. For external images, verify the URLs are still valid

### Responsive Design Issues
If the layout doesn't look right on certain devices:
1. Check the responsive media queries in `styles.css`
2. Adjust breakpoints as needed for your specific content
